One of my favorite foods is dosa. It has Crispy Texture and Flavor The outer layer of dosa is perfectly crispy, while the inside can be soft, making for a delightful combination. Its slightly tangy taste, due to the fermented batter, adds a unique flavor. Dosa can be enjoyed in many different forms. Whether it's the classic plain dosa, masala dosa stuffed with spiced potatoes, or variations like onion dosa or cheese dosa, thereâ€™s always something new to try. Dosa is traditionally served with sambar and a variety of chutneys. The combination of these flavors makes each bite exciting and delicious.
